# A Ride to the moon

It's a small game with html, css and js where it allows the user to switch characters, choosing levels.

live server would be much better. The music starts when the game starts. if it's not, try refreshing the page.

Refreshing web page before playing the gameatleast 6 times is highly recommended.
